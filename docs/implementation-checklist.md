# ProvenLoop Implementation Checklist

**Status:** Active  
**Updated:** 2026-09-01

**Immediate target:** M0 observation foundation, followed by the M1 + M2
validated MVP.

This checklist turns the product design, architecture, roadmap, and validation
documents into an executable delivery order. Work is complete only when its
behavior is covered by the evaluation spine; code completion alone is not
completion.

## 1. Delivery rules

- [ ] Keep the MVP a TypeScript/Node.js modular monolith: a small Copilot
  capture Extension and one shared local host.
- [ ] Treat SQLite domain state as canonical; FTS, rendered context, and agent
  assets are rebuildable projections.
- [ ] Keep Extension callbacks bounded: copy allowed fields, enqueue to memory,
  and return without synchronous I/O.
- [ ] Fail closed for retrieval and learning; failure must never block normal
  Copilot use or fabricate successful state.
- [ ] Require stable IDs, provenance, scope, evidence state, and deletion state
  for every persisted or retrieved item.
- [ ] Add a Requirement Manifest, Replay Spec, deterministic verifier, and
  expected evidence for every product or safety promise.
- [ ] Record errors explicitly; do not silently accept malformed events,
  unknown versions, failed inference, or incomplete process claims.
- [ ] Implement and accept Windows 10/11 first. Keep platform-sensitive behavior
  behind explicit interfaces.
- [ ] Do not implement automatic Playbook generation or activation before M1
  and M2 pass their Go/No-Go gates.

## 2. Dependency order

```text
F0 integration spikes
  -> workspace and shared contracts
  -> evaluation spine
  -> redaction and durable queue
  -> canonical SQLite and worker
  -> Copilot adapter and control CLI
  -> basic Work Episode builder
  -> M0 acceptance
  -> M1 Branch Context and retrieval
  -> M2 correction learning
  -> M1 + M2 product evaluation
```

Independent work may proceed in parallel only after its shared contracts are
frozen.

## 3. F0: feasibility decisions

### 3.1 Copilot integration spike

- [x] Record the first supported Copilot CLI version range.
- [x] Verify available lifecycle hooks and their payload/version behavior.
- [x] Verify local MCP registration, startup, shutdown, and stdio behavior.
- [ ] Verify plugin install, upgrade, disable, uninstall, and idempotent
  reinstallation. Local marketplace lifecycle passes; remote upgrade remains
  blocked by F0-003.
- [x] Verify internal ProvenLoop work can be marked with
  `PROVENLOOP_INTERNAL=1`.
- [x] Verify supported background inference can reuse the existing Copilot
  sign-in without copying credentials, an additional API key, or per-call
  authorization.
- [x] Document degradation when Copilot is signed out, rate-limited, or
  incompatible.
- [x] Prove hook and MCP failure do not block foreground Copilot use.
- [x] Select the Extension event stream as the primary capture candidate and
  document its fallback, privacy, recovery, and Go/No-Go design.
- [x] Verify a plugin Extension can join the active Session and subscribe to
  required `session.on(...)` events.
- [x] Verify Extension callbacks are notification-only and do not wait for
  persistence or downstream processing.
- [x] Verify the Extension excludes registered internal Session IDs before
  copying content.
- [x] Verify Extension opt-in persists for ordinary `copilot` launches and a
  settings-based rollback stops Extension loading.
- [ ] Verify plugin disable and uninstall preserve prior user experimental
  settings while stopping the Extension.
- [x] Measure at least 500 Extension events on Windows 11 and verify required
  event coverage, event IDs, delivery freshness, callback work duration,
  failure isolation, and metadata-only persistence.
- [x] Accept the Extension event stream as feasible and unblock Batch 1
  workspace and shared-contract implementation.
- [ ] Complete F0-001 with Windows 10, paired foreground A/B latency,
  cancel/resume/subagent coverage, concurrent load and queue-failure tests,
  Session file reconciliation, and installed-plugin lifecycle validation
  before M0 acceptance.

### 3.2 Local runtime spike

- [x] Select and verify the SQLite driver on Node.js 22 for Windows packaging,
  WAL, transactions, migrations, and FTS5.
- [x] Verify atomic queue writes and replacement behavior on Windows.
- [x] Verify the process lease or named-mutex approach releases correctly after
  crashes.
- [x] Define the Windows data-root, log, artifact, queue, and evaluation paths.
- [x] Measure cold start, idle memory, queue throughput, and baseline capture
  overhead.

### 3.3 Exit criteria

- [x] Capture the decisions in architecture decision records or the relevant
  architecture sections.
- [x] Convert every unresolved feasibility risk into a blocking issue with an
  owner and a testable exit condition.
- [x] Do not begin broad implementation while authentication reuse, capture
  non-blocking behavior, or SQLite packaging remains unproven.

  `CorrectionOpportunity`.
- [x] Implement `RequirementManifest`, `ReplaySpec`, `EvidenceLedgerEntry`, and
  `GateResult`.

  - `0`: required gates passed
  - `1`: product or safety gate failed
  - `2`: invalid manifest, spec, or input
  - `3`: infrastructure error
- [x] Add schema compatibility tests and invalid-input fixtures.

### 4.3 Definition of done

  platform package.

## 7. Batch 4: canonical storage and shared worker

### 7.1 Database

- [x] Create versioned, transactional migrations.

- [x] Parse adapter events into canonical events.
- [x] Commit one processing unit transactionally.
- [x] Acknowledge only after the canonical transaction succeeds.

- [x] Publish an actual capability matrix for the installed Copilot version.
- [x] Detect internal ProvenLoop sessions and suppress recursive capture.
- [x] Tolerate unsupported Copilot versions without breaking the CLI.

### 8.2 CLI

- [x] `provenloop install`
- [x] `provenloop status`
- [x] `provenloop doctor`
- [x] `provenloop enable <capability>`

- [x] Queue health, backlog, retry, and dead-letter count.
- [x] Worker lease and recent heartbeat.
- [ ] Copilot version, sign-in availability, Extension registration, and MCP
  registration. Version and registration checks are implemented; Copilot CLI
  does not expose a non-interactive credential-status command, so sign-in
  availability remains explicit but unverified.
- [x] Capability state and last explicit error for each consumer.
- [x] Redaction and end-to-end synthetic-event self-test.

### 8.4 Definition of done

- [x] ProvenLoop can be stopped or broken while Copilot remains usable.
- [x] Installation requires no wrapper command for ordinary Copilot use.
- [x] Daily operation requires no additional model API key.
- [ ] Capability disable stops only the selected capture, retrieval, or worker
  behavior. Capture and the on-demand worker are operational; retrieval remains
  unavailable until its runtime consumer is wired to the shared capability
  state.

## 9. Batch 6: basic Work Episode builder

### 9.1 Deterministic grouping

- [x] Keep low-confidence associations as candidates.
- [x] Support user correction of merge and split decisions in the domain model.

### 9.2 Episode state

- [x] Record sessions, branches, commits, PRs, issues, timing, corrections, and
  outcome evidence references.
- [x] Keep `outcome` separate from `outcomeQualification`.

- [x] Association recall is at least 90%.
- [x] Wrong merges are visible as a distinct release metric.

- [ ] Online fine-tuning or parameter training.

These items must not expand the first implementation batch.

## 15. First executable slice

The first coding slice should prove one complete path before adding more event
types:

```text
fixture Extension event
  -> envelope validation
  -> write-time redaction
  -> atomic durable queue
  -> worker claim
  -> canonical parser
  -> SQLite transaction
  -> Evidence Ledger
  -> deterministic Gate
  -> JSON/Markdown report and stable exit code
```

The slice is complete when:

- [ ] a valid event passes;
- [ ] a malformed event remains visible and fails;
- [ ] a duplicate event is idempotent;
- [ ] a seeded secret is absent from persisted content;
- [ ] a worker crash can recover the item;
- [ ] a completion claim without invocation evidence fails with exit code `1`;
- [ ] the same results are reproducible from a clean checkout.
